review:"I have worked with Vetted Trainers on several occasions. Joel designed a great fitness program that has improved my overall health. Also, when various musculoskeletal issues related to sports and exercise have arisen, Vetted Trainers , with their phenomenal knowledge of kinesiology, has solved a number of my issues. Throughout my program, Joel is a great motivator, and always offers options for improvement at my own level. This level of customized service is hard to find in today's fitness arena. I highly recommend Vetted Trainers. ",

review: "Joel and Vetted Trainers takes a wholistic approach to building strength and Injury recovery. Their wealth of knowledge allows them to make custom tailored programs to your specific needs. After I tore my meniscus, Joel developed a program that focused on mobility, muscle releases, and strength training to break down the scar tissue in my knee and increase mobility. Once I had a strong foundation, Joel's training built up the strength in my knee and helped prevent injuries in the future. I can't recommend him enough! ",
