    bio: "Meet Joel Arias! Joel is at the helm as the fearless leader of Vetted Trainers, has designed all of the movement programs, and developed the movement ideology behind Vetted Trainers. Joel has always had a perspicacity into human movement, but a serious knee injury took him on a journey that led him to create a system to give people hope again. He was told that he would never have speed or power in his leg again and he would not accept this. He created a system to heal his knee and now he and his team go after any movement issues that keep you from pursuing your best life!",

Joey will evaluate your musculoskeletal system in your first session so that you understand the root of your pain. He will then design a movement program for you that will lead to physical victory with the most rapidity. Tony then takes this information and finds the perfect Personal Trainer to guide you through your journey!",
